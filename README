Three data structures are defined in the file implementation.py. At the bottom of implementation.py are three functions that illustrate how to use these structures.


The functions for each data structure should be used as follows:
Bloom:
__init__(self, max_elements, error_rate):
Constructor. Provide the desired maximum number of elements and the desired maximum false positive probability.

build_filter(self, keys):
Builds the data structure on the keys provided.
	
query_filter(self, key):
Queries the structure for the key provided.
	
size(self):
Returns the size of the internal bbhash data structure as reported by Pympler's asizeof().
		
MPHF:
__init__(self):
Constructor.
	
build_table(self, keys):
Builds the data structure on the keys provided.
	
query_table(self, key):
Queries the structure for the key provided.
	
size(self):
Returns the size of the internal bbhash data structure as reported by its get_mem() function.
		
AugMPHF:
__init__(self, num_elements, fingerprint_size):
Constructor. Provide the number of elements to be stored in the hash table and the number of bits to store for each fingerprint.
	
build_table(self, keys):
Builds the data structure on the keys provided.
	
query_table(self, key):
Queries the structure for the key provided.
	
size(self):
Returns the size of the auxiliary array. Does not return the size of the bbhash object.
